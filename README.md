### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### What I learned
In this challenge I learned a stronger and proper validation form that checks for text format and required symbols while giving feedback to user if they entered a valid or invalid email address format.


### Continued development
In my future project I want to continue developing my JS skills and get a deeper understanding of custom form validations with Regex(Regular expression).

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) -This MDN was very useful for me, showing different methods of validating a form. I will definitely save it and practice for more validation forms.
